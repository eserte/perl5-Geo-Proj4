PROJ.4 offers a C<pj_transform()> function that would be really
cool to add to this module, but... PROJ.4 expects spherical coordinates
(i.e. lat and long) in radians, whereas most ordinary people think
of lat and long in degrees. Ordinarily, Geo::Proj4 takes care of this
for you transparently, but in the case of the proposed C<transform()>
method, the list of points to be transformed between two cartographic
projections might be spherical or planar in zero, one, or both of the
input and output lists. We could supply helper functions to allow a
developer to perform the degree-to-radian and reverse as needed before
or after the call to C<transform()>, but... would anyone use this,
or would you just rely on cs2cs?

Passing undef as the value to a boolean parameter is an ugly interface.
                                                                                
Needs more tests!  Especially of border cases.
                                                                                
Needs more samples in the samples directory!
